## Projects

### Todo

It's the hello world of web apps! We will be building a web
application for a single user to track a single to do list. We will
build a web interface for the list that will allow the user to create,
update, remove, and mark (or unmark) as completed to do items. The
todo list data will be stored in a SQL database (in Postgresql). The
backend server will be written in Node and Express (and deployed to
Heroku) and the front end will be implemented with a combination of
Angular and jQuery. The source code will be stored in Git and
published on GitHub.
